# gps-tracker

A hardware project for determining and logging location data. It is devoted to solving problems of determining the position of a moving object, which users need to observe. The project offers an implementation of a GPS tracking unit based on Arduino platform. These devices can be used to track vehicles, family members, employees, etc. The tracker receives the GPS signal and calculates the coordinates. When the location data are saved in the internal memory of the microcontroller, the tracker transmits it by using mobile network. If the connection is lost, the device logs coordinates in a MicroSD card. There is also a software part of the project, that is created for logging the data from devices.
